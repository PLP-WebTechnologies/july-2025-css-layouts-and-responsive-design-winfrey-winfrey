                Overview. In this assignment, you'll learn how to bring
                structure, flexibility, and responsiveness to your web pages
                using modern CSS layout techniques—Flexbox and Grid. You'll also
                apply Responsive Web Design (RWD) principles to ensure your page
                adapts beautifully across screen sizes and devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Objective is to build a responsive multi-section webpage that
                uses Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout and demonstrates how
                content adjusts across mobile, tablet, and desktop views. You'll
                showcase your ability to align and position content with
                precision, using media queries and flexible units to enhance the
                user experience on any device.

                What You’ll Practice Structuring content using Flexbox for 1D
                layouts (rows or columns) Using CSS Grid for complex 2D layouts
                Applying responsive design techniques using media queries and
                relative units (%, rem, vw, etc.) Creating layouts that
                gracefully adapt to different screen sizes without breaking
              </p>
              <p>
                Creating a responsive webpage that contains multiple
                sections—such as a header, navigation bar, content area,
                sidebar, and footer using Flexbox in one part of the page and
                Grid in another (e.g., Grid for the main layout and Flexbox for
                cards or navigation alignment).
              </p>
              <p>
                The layout looks good on desktop, tablet, and mobile. It also
                uses media queries to adjust column layout, spacing, or
                visibility. Additionally, it demonstrates thoughtful content
                placement using both layout models. Tips include Effective use
                of Flexbox and CSS Grid layout techniques Visual clarity and
                logical content flow across screen sizes Proper use of media
                queries and responsive units Code readability, organization, and
                best practices Creativity and attention to layout detail
